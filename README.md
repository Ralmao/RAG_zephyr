A rag is a process for generating text from a sequence of words. It works by first splitting the sequence into smaller chunks, and then generating text for each chunk. The generated text for each chunk is then combined to form the final output.

Llama2 is a large language model (LLM) from Google AI. It is trained on a massive dataset of text and code, and can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

Langchain is a technique for generating text that is more coherent and informative than traditional rag methods. It works by using a chain of language models to generate the text. Each language model in the chain takes the output of the previous language model as input, and generates text that is consistent with the previous output.
